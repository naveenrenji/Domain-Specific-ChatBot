3,1,Elevate and slant the drum more to allow water to drain better.
3,4,Improve energy efficiency from smart rotation regime setting based on load and dirt.
3,4,"Passive damping mechanism could be used to replace the expensive gas springs. For example, tension network structures (""tensegrity"" systems), have tunable stiffness and damping which are only controlled by the number and orientation of cables. These structures are cheaper than gas springs, since seals and bearings are not required."
3,3,"Come up with efficient energy conversion from electricity to mechanical movement (i.e., spinning)."
3,4,"Incorporate drying mechanism inside the washer itself, so that when the clothes are dried and the water vapor exits the wash chamber, the water vapor can be re-captured and re-used in subsequent wash cycles."
3,5,Use magnetic induction based heating and washing (sonic vibration).
4,3,"Use alternative energy source, such as connect to wind turbine to leverage rotational kinetic energy as opposed to electric energy."
3,4,Ultrasonic wave can be applied inside the drum to detach dirt from the laundry and use less detergent and less tumbling energy.
3,5,Use rfid tags that specify wash requirements to simplify the process of washing various types of fabrics.
3,1,Use freeze cleaning.
3,4,The washing machine can act as a storage for clothes and will wash whenever the cloth is dirty or smelly.
5,2,"Since some bulky clothes or blankets need more rinsing, make some more options for the users to set the rinsing cycle to be twice as long."
5,2,Make it possible for the user to specify how dirty the clothes are in a scale of 1 to 10 and the washing machine can adjust the amount of detergents to use.
3,2,Add sound absorbing liner to reduce cycle noise.
3,2,Analyze relationship between spin acceleration rate and energy consumption to optimize the use of electricity at the beginning of spin stage.
5,3,"An internet connected washer with access to energy price data, allowing it to schedule washing tasks when electricity is cheapest."
3,1,Create a product which can be easily upgradable or repairable to reduce new purchases.
4,1,"Use steam cleaning, so that the clothes can be hanged inside the machine and be ironed and cleaned at the same time."
4,1,Have a washing machine that has LED readouts and membrane switch buttons instead of the more traditional nobs or dials and tactile buttons.
3,1,Use new material to make clothes that need less cleaning.
5,1,Paint the washing machines in different colors to coordinate with people's home decoration.
3,4,Machine has learning abilities and automatically sets the time and type of wash cycles based on user wash history.
2,4,"Incorporate a heat exchanger inside the washing machine to re-capture the heat that's lost to the environment due to machine operation, and use that energy to power the washing machine later (for example, add a rechargeable battery). The heat that could be captured could be from the motor mechanism, or from the hot water that exits the appliance after a hot-water wash cycle."
5,5,Have an old fashioned hand crank if people want to power their washing machine that way.
4,2,"Bring buttons back: let users save their favorite washing cycles in several buttons, maybe from 1 to 5, like slots."
3,3,"Use mechanical agitation in the absence of water to remove larger particles from the clothing, and only use water in later cycles to remove small dirt particles, thus reducing water usage."
3,1,"A washing machine that is taller and thinner than normal, to avoid having such a larger footprint, but capable of the same capacity."
3,1,Install and attach the machine to the floor so that the weight of the concrete and therefore the weight of the machine can be reduced to reduce the transportation cost and impact.
2,1,Have service model for centralized laundry. It creates jobs and scale to improve quality and efficiency
4,1,Provide a way that users can monitor the amount of overall power consumed by the washing machine during each cycle and track this use over time.
3,4,Create odor and stain removing sticky tabs that you just need to use in the areas of your clothing that you need to wash.
3,1,Use natural materials that can be easily renewed.
4,3,Have white and non-white modes for the machine and allowing usage of only certain detergents for white clothes and non-white saving the environment from use of harmful products.
4,3,Have a whitening cycle that whitens better without bleach.
3,1,Allow customers to customize color and style for different parts of the machine.
3,1,Washing drum is made corrosion free for longer life.
2,4,"To save water, blow out dirt with air and then use less water for cleaning."
5,1,"Have a door that opens all the way upwards so that it lays on top of the washing machine, to enable easy loading."
5,1,Use a touchscreen because everyone loves touch screens.
3,4,Use sensors to control ratio of the amount of water and detergent.
4,1,Have easy loading and deloading feature.
5,1,"Display has a ""time remaining"" indicator for the wash cycle."
3,3,Use unibody style design to reduce parts and increase quality.
3,5,Use bio-inspired design once again using how ants have scoops on their sides that manage water.
4,1,Have an efficiency indicator to allow users to see the results of their behavior.
5,5,Use human powered washers.
2,4,Optimize washing of loads given the amount of clothes and dirty particles present. Using sensor would help find the minimum amount of water and spin cycles needed to get the job done.
5,1,Shrink design for smaller load capacity for people who live alone.
3,3,Re-design the drum with a geometry that keeps clothes more separated from each other and prevents clothing from stacking on top of each other. It might help speed up the cleaning process and reduce water usage.
3,4,Use water flow as a hybrid power generator.
