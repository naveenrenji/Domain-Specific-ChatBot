        This research introduces an AI-driven chatbot designed to evaluate
        engineering design descriptions based on novelty, feasibility, and
        validity, addressing the challenges of efficient and accurate
        assessment. Leveraging fine-tuned BERT base uncased models, the chatbot
        assesses user inputs through a three-step process, achieving accuracies
        of 80-85%. The system's architecture and integration of AI models
        streamline evaluation, offering a rapid alternative to traditional
        human-based methods. This research introduces an AI-driven chatbot
